	<p>There is a train headed towards five people tied to a track <br /> 
	   In front of you, and next to the tracks, there is an extremely large man. <br />
	   Through some quick calculations you realise that pushing this man onto the tracks will stop the train, and end his life, <br \> 
	   but this will also save the five people on the tracks. You have to decide now, Do you push him?<p>
